# forward-forward-algorithm

PyTorch implementation of [Forward-Forward Algorithm](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/FFA13.pdf) introduced by Geoffrey Hinton in 2022.

The [notebook](./supervised_ffa_mnist.ipynb) in this repo attempts to implement supervised forward-forward algorithm on MNIST dataset described in Section 3.3. 


## Additional Resources
* My implementation is improved version of [Mohammad Pezeshki's implementation](https://github.com/mohammadpz/pytorch_forward_forward)
* (Martin GÃ¶rner's high level explanation)[[https://twitter.com/martin_gorner/status/1599755684941557761]] can be a good starting point
